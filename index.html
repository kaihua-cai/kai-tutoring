        <p>This is Kaihua, a math PhD and IMO medalist. I could help you if you are working on AMC 10/12,
            or preparing for AIME and USAMO/USAJMO.
            Even better, I am happy to discuss any math problem and answer questions just for the purpose of learning.
        </p>

        <p> I help students learning math on two aspects:
        </p>

        <h3>Part 1: Provide guidance and comments to the students in a realtime fashion</h3>
        <p> Even the best students encounter various challenges when they learn math on their own, such as
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>a hard problem with no solution,</li>
            <li>the students understand the solution step-by-step, but have little idea where the solution comes from,</li>
            <li>a concept could be understood, but the students have difficulty to see its extension and applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Typically, the students learn something and miss something all at once.
            When they come into the same concept next time, they would probably learn more.
            However, by providing the comments and guidance
            on these challenges on a realtime passion (in real life, it is as fast as the same day),
            I help to make
            the learning process more efficient, and more satisfying for the students.
        </p>

        <h3>Part 2: Weekly 1-1 session for in-depth learning</h3>
        <p> For most students, the most efficient way to learn math is to listen to a lecture and do a few
            problems afterward. I offer the 1-1 sessions, tailoring to the need and level of the students.
            It could be going over the problems of the past AIME exams, or going over chapters on the AOPS books,
            or books in the series of New Mathematical Library.
        </p>
        <p>
            I regularly post interesting math problems here. You are encouraged to reach out to share
            your solutions and ask for it. You are also welcome to reach out to me if you are interested in
            my tutoring service. Text/WhatsApp: 917-754-0988, or email kaihua.cai@gmail.com
        </p>

         <h3>Interesting problems to solve:</h3>

         <h4>Prob No 1</h4>

         <p>Use +, -, *, /, (, and ) on each of the following four integers to produce 24 </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3, 3, 7, 7</li>
            <li>4, 4, 7, 7</li>
            <li>4, 4, 10, 10</li>
        </ul>
        <p> For example, for 1,2,4,8 </p>
